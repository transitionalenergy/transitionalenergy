- 👋 Hi, I’m @transitionalenergy
- 👀 I’m interested in electrifying the world with geothermal energy. The heat under our feet is renewable and provides baseload power for humanity.
- 🌱 I’m currently working in Python and R on data wrangling and visualization projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on subsurface geothermal projects.
- 📫 Reach us at transitionalenergy.us and at info@transitional.energy
